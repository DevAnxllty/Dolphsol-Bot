# Dolphsol Bot

A discord bot utility for the Dolphsol Macro in Sol's RNG

This project has been discontinued, it wont work anymore and it shows up as a trojan. It shows up as a trojan because the python packing system I used gets flagged by your anti-virus because other malicious users like to use the program I used to hide malware. I even posted up the source code if you would like to search through that and use that instead.
